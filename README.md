# DocTest
#This is a program written using Javascript and Nodejs.

#To run this program, download all the files and go to the terminal and type - "node index.js"

#This program will compare two files(eg. docx,txt,etc) and check how much similar they are to each other, number of words in files.
And then count the number of nouns, adjectives and verbs and basis of that it will tell if the file seems good or not with respect to base file.
